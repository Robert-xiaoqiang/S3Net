# Spatial-Context-Fusion-Net
we conduct a fusion between adjacent resolutions of both images and depth and gradient descent with moving average guided target

# contribution
- a novel cross-modal fusion strategy used to leverage spatially-adjacent complementary information
- a dice-like loss desgined to enhance RGBD-based SOD
- a self-ensembling mechanism to utilize unlabeled RGBD data guided by stable targets
